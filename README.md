# custom-lexer-and-parser
This includes a basic recreation of a lexer and parser, it tokenizes c++ source code then checks for syntax errors converts the expressions into an AST which is then converted into an ASTNode object to give the parsed expression more context, included is example source code it parsed which I then visualized the AST made from it.
